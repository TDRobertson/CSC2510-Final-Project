Create 7 total servers
1 ansiible management server running centOS
3 web servers running Debian that allow http and https traffic
3 webserver + database server hybrids that run Debian and allow http and https traffic.

After servers are setup:
1) Change the root password for all of the vms by using sudo passwd (enter password) to something you will store in cleartext later on.
2) Then on all the Debian servers change the /etc/ssh/sshd_config using sudo nano and change PermitRootLogin to yes and change PasswordAuthentication to yes. You can save your changes using ctrl + x then entering y.
(Optionally change password authentication on the AMS server as well if you plan on remotely controlling it outside of gcp).
3) Install ansible on the AMS using sudo yum install ansible and accept all dependencies.
4) Navigate to the ansible config file on the AMS using sudo nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
(Note: You will need to install nano on the AMS, as it does not come pre-installed with centOS servers, use sudo yum install nano).
5) In the ansible.cfg file uncomment the host_key_checking = False command around line 71.
6) Now navigate to the AMS ansible host file using sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts and set up all the groups for the webservers and hybrid servers using their internal IPs (which wont change between sessions) and adding in the ansible_user and ansible_password in grouped variables. (IMPORTANT: Spelling must be EXACTLY the same, or it will not work)
Note* Logging in as root gives us elevated permissions for installing/running everything on the remote servers.
ex:
# Grouped Webservers Dev Env
 [webserversdev]
 10.128.0.30

 [webserversdev:vars]
 ansible_user=root
 ansible_password=Mickey2023!

# Grouped Database Servers Dev Env
 [hybridsdev]
 10.128.0.31

 [hybridsdev:vars]
 ansible_user=root
 ansible_password=Mickey2023!

# Grouped Webservers Test  Env
 [webserverstest]
 10.128.0.26

 [webserverstest:vars]
 ansible_user=root
 ansible_password=Mickey2023!

# Grouped Database Servers Test Env
 [hybridstest]
 10.128.0.27

 [hybridstest:vars]
 ansible_user=root
 ansible_password=Mickey2023!

7) Set up your ssh authentication key on the AMS default directory.
8) Once the above steps are completed restart all of the servers to finalize changes.
9) Log back into the AMS and create and move into a ansible_playbooks directory where you will store your playbooks and bash scripts.
10) Copy the provided playbooks and scripts into the directory.
11) Run the
